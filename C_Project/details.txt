# C_Project : Clinic

Our project is a doctor clinic. At the start of program you should choose one of 5 operations. 
First is adding new patient to the system. so, you should enter all the data of patient like first and last name,
age, gender, blood type and contact number. You also should choose examination or consultation. program will show
the patient's id, cost and time you should go to the clinic due to your choice. note that examination cost is 200$
for those whose age is less than or equal 12 and 300$ for more than 12.examinataion takes 20 minutes for each patient.
But consultation has a fixed cost (150$) and it takes 15 minutes for each patient.
Second option is printing data, you should enter the patient's id then the program will show his data. 
Third option is deleting patient's data, you should enter his id then the program will delete it,
so if you try to do any operation with this id the program will print "wrong id".
Fourth option is updating patient's data, you should enter his id then his updated age and contact number then
choose examination or consultation. For example, if patient's age is 12 and he will choose examination, the cost
will be 200. After 1 year, if he updated his age so it will be 13, if he choose examination again the program
will print the new cost (300$) due to updated age.
Finally, Fifth option is Exiting program. If user choose it, the program will print the total number of patients
and the total money they have paid, then end the program.
